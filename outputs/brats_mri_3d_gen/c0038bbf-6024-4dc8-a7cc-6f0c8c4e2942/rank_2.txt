The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future, please use 'weights' instead.
Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future. The current behavior is equivalent to passing `weights=SqueezeNet1_1_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1`. You can also use `weights=SqueezeNet1_1_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.
